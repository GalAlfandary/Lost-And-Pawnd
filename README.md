## ‚ú® What is Lost & Pawnd?

Lost & Pawnd is a React-Native + Expo app that lets anyone

1. **Snap or upload a photo** of a pet they found (or lost).  
2. **Run a vision pipeline** (OpenCV + TensorFlow Lite) on-device to extract colour, breed and facial-landmark features.  
3. **Query the cloud database** for visually similar pets.  
4. **Contact the matching owner / finder** through chat or one-tap call.

Our goal: cut the time between ‚ÄúI lost my dog‚Äù and ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs back on the couch‚Äù from days to minutes.
