# Software Test Plan (STP) - Lost and Pawnd

## 1. Introduction
This Software Test Plan outlines the testing strategy for the Lost and Pawnd application. The objective is to ensure the correct functioning of pet registration, image comparison, and notification features for reuniting lost pets with their owners.

## 2. Test Items
- Pet Registration Module
- Image Comparison Engine
- Notification System
- User Authentication Module
- Database Integration

## 3. Features to be Tested
- Pet image upload and storage
- AI-powered pet image comparison
- Email notification system
- User registration and login
- Pet profile management
- Match result processing

## 4. Features Not to be Tested
- Social media sharing integration
- Payment processing (future version)
- Advanced analytics dashboard (future version)
- Multi-language support (future version)

## 5. Testing Strategy
We will conduct:
- Unit testing for frontend components and backend services
- Integration testing for API endpoints and database operations
- System testing for end-to-end user flows
- Performance testing for image processing
- Security testing for user data protection

## 6. Test Environment
- Frontend: React Native mobile app
- Backend: Python/Quart API server
- Database: Supabase
- AI/ML: PyTorch image comparison
- Testing Devices: iOS and Android simulators, physical test devices

## 7. Responsibilities
- Frontend Team: React Native component testing
- Backend Team: API and database testing
- AI Team: Image comparison algorithm testing
- QA Team: System and user acceptance testing
- DevOps: Performance and security testing

## 8. Schedule
- Unit Testing: Weeks 1-2
- Integration Testing: Weeks 3-4
- System Testing: Weeks 5-6
- Performance Testing: Week 7
- Security Testing: Week 8
- User Acceptance Testing: Week 9

## 9. Risks and Contingencies
- AI model accuracy variations
  - Contingency: Implement fallback comparison methods
- Image processing performance issues
  - Contingency: Optimize image size and implement caching
- Email delivery delays
  - Contingency: Implement retry mechanism and alternative notification methods
- Database connection issues
  - Contingency: Implement connection pooling and retry logic
